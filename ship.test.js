// 1. Begin your app by creating the Ship factory function. 
// a) Your ships will be objects that include their length, the number of times theyve been hit and whether or not theyve been sunk. 
// b) REMEMBER you only have to test your objects public interface. Only methods or properties that are used outside of your ship object need unit tests. 
// c) Ships should have a hit() function that increases the number of hits in your ship. 
// d) isSunk() should be a function that calculates it based on their length and the number of hits.
