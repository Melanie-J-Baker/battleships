// 4.  Create the main game loop and a module for DOM interaction.
// a) At this point it is appropriate to begin crafting your User Interface.
// b) The game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards.
// For now just populate each Gameboard with predetermined coordinates. Can implement a system for allowing players to place their ships later.
// c) HTML implementation up to you, but should display both the player’s boards and render them using information from the Gameboard class.
//     i) Need methods to render gameboards and to take user input for attacking. For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard.
// d) The game loop should step through game turn by turn using only methods from other objects.
// If tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and work out which class or module that function should belong to.
// e) Create conditions so that the game ends once one players ships have all been sunk. This function is appropriate for the Game module.

// 5. Finish it up
// a) There are several options available for letting users place their ships. You can let them type coordinates for each ship, or investigate implementing drag and drop.
// b) You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.
// c) Optionally, create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth. If you’re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each others boards!
